# Homework 02: Professional Portfolio

## The assignment

From scratch, I was tasked with creating a portfolio. There were Acceptance Criteria for the assignment which are shown below.  

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Portfolio

The portfolio was made with responsive design in mind so it should be viewable on all types of screens. In addition, to the work section, for each work thumbnail, there is a blur affect added. If you hovor over the thumbnails, the blur is removed and the thumbnail size is increased.
